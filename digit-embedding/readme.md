## Digit Embedding

This directory contains the code for generating the embedding for numbers. 

1. First download the following feature mapping from the link. 

`https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ytqb6y407odHKPnU6V4HfQkyg2C0XLB/view?usp=drive_link`

2. Extract the zip file and keep it in the same directory as the python file.

2. Then run the following command to generate the embedding for numbers in range `(1, 50)` and numbers in range 
`(200050, 200100)`.

`python DigitEmbedding_proper_upload.py`

3. Right now we generate 3-d embedding for each number. 

4. However, the code can be easily extended to generate embedding of any size.
